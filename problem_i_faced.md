1.not printing array element properly after single index
reason- since i used this method
----------------------------------
/2 array element deleting//status - sucess
// let arr2=[1,2,3,4];
// let i=1
// arr2.splice(i,1)
// // i mean which index will be delete
// // argument 2nd=1 mean how many index after i will be delete
// console.log(arr2)"
----------------------------------------
so problem is that i taking single digit as input so 
learning point= always use a proper approach and dont go to a sortcut

# note- this is my first debugging or a problem faced
